//Intervals in streaming

1. Batch Interval

    The time interval in which data is ingested.
    Each new DStream is created after the time interval is reached
    Eg: after 1 second, new DStream will be created which will contain multiple RDD's

2. Slide Interval

    The time interval in which transformation is applied on the data
    Eg: after 2 seconds the result is computed by applying the transformations pervious 3 seconds of data (window interval)

3. Window Interval

    The time interval for which the data is kept and computed for transormation
    Eg: every 3 seconds of data is taken for computing the result after every 2 seconds (slide interval)


//Spark

1. Broadcast variables

    Transferred to all the nodes as is (not distributed in chunks)

2. Accumulators:

    Shared variable across all the nodes.
